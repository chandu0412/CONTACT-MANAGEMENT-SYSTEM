The Contact Management System is a Python-based application designed for managing personal and professional contacts. It allows users to perform essential contact management functions such as adding new contacts, updating existing ones, and deleting unwanted entries. The system captures vital information like the first name, last name, gender, age, address, and contact number for each contact, providing a well-organized and user-friendly interface.

This project uses the Tkinter library to create an intuitive graphical user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their contacts efficiently. SQLite3 is used for database handling, ensuring data is stored securely and can be accessed quickly when needed. The project also features a search functionality, enabling users to find specific contacts based on criteria such as name or contact number. This system demonstrates strong proficiency in Python programming, GUI development with Tkinter, and database management with SQLite3.
